                When will the pre-sale and token sale happen?
                We’re working with security auditors to finalise the contract. When they have
                completed their analysis we will announce the confirmed dates of both the
                pre-sale and token sale. Note that the ASR pre-sale and token sale parameters
                will be tied to the block number, so times will depend on Ethereum mining
                rates. The contract will be pushed to github and Ethereum mainnet at least 3
                days before the presale starts. We’ll also give people a week to interact with the
                contract on Ropsen / testnet.

                    Asure chose to raise funds through an ICO/TGE because it is a better fit to our business model as a blockchain foundation that seeks to provide a decentralized autonomous insurance platform to the masses.

The non-discounted exchange rate will be 12,000 ASR per ETH. With the maximum discount for presale participants of 15,600 ASR per ETH."},
//                {q:"Which wallet can be used to store ASR?",a:"ASR is an ERC20 token, meaning it can be stored in ERC20 compatible wallets such as MyEtherWallet. After ICO will be released Web / Desktop / Mobile wallets then you can store them there."},
